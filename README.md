### sbSchemaParser

The `sbSchemaParser.pl` script is used to process schema files written in
*JSON Schema* (YAML version) into human-readable documentation (e.g. Markdown files for Jekyll
based HTML generation) and JSON data files from the embedded examples.

Directives for source and target directories can be modified in the `config.yaml` file in the script's directory.
